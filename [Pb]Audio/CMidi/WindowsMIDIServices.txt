The following process must be repeated each time Visual Studio [2022] updates to a new Windows Runtime (WinRT) version 
prior to (re)building the CMidi.dll project with Visual Studio:

1.  Obtain the source, NuGet packages and ensure proper vc14 redist for building Windows MIDI Services (WMS) release.

2.  Build the cpp-winrt sample applications in the Windows MIDI Services Release to generate WinRT projection headers
    for the version of the Windows Runtime (WinRT) used by the given Windows MIDI Services release.

3.  Copy the the NuGet generated WinRT projection headers to be used as includes in your Win32 WinRT Wrapper dll library vcxproj.
    (From Project/Intermediate/x64/Release/Generated Files/winrt)

4.  Copy the NuGet package Microsoft.Windows.Devices.Midi2.*.dll(s) (in runtimes/win-x64/native) to your workspace bin 
    for linking WinRT ABI implementations at runtime (only the following at minimum are needed):

	Midi2
	Midi2.Diagnostics
	Midi2.Initialization
