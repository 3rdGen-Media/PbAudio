# [Pb]Audio

[Physics-based] Audio is a cross-platform pure C library for establishing and producing to lowest-possible-latency audio stream buffers intended for Pro Audio mixing/rendering contexts, 3D environment mixing/rendering contexts and pipeline combinations thereof to stereo and multiple output audio hardware devices as well as network endpoints.  [Pb]Audio aims to implement the following non-standard features for all supported platforms:

* To Be Written

*[Pb]Audio is the modular audio counterpart to the CoreRender framework.  Together, [Pb]Audio, CoreTransport and CoreRender's modular C libraries embody the foundational layer of 3rdGen's proprietary render engine and cross-platform application framework, Cobalt Rhenium.*
